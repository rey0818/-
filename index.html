      <p>A paperclip, made of steel wire bent into a hooped shape, is an instrument used to hold sheets of paper together. This common <input class="blank "id="blank-0" type="text"> is a wonder of simplicity and function. But where did this simple, cheap, and indispensable invention come from?<br><br>
        In the late 19th century, the most common way to hold papers together was by using a pin. Although the pin was an inexpensive tool and was easily <input class="blank "id="blank-1" type="text">, it would leave holes in the paper. Later, as steel 
        wire became more common, inventors began to notice its elastic feature. With this feature, it could be stretched and <input class="blank "id="blank-2" type="text">,various clip-like objects. In the years just prior to 1900, quite a few paperclip 
        designs emerged. The name most frequently <input class="blank "id="blank-3" type="text"> the paperclip invention is Johan Vaaler, a Norwegian inventor. However, Vaaler’s clips were not the same as the paperclips currently in use. Specifically, they did not have the interior loop we see today. The <input class="blank "id="blank-4" type="text"> 
        looped design was invented by Gem Manufacturing Ltd. in England. This clip is therefore sometimes <input class="blank "id="blank-5" type="text"> the Gem clip.<br><br>
        Because of Vaaler, the paperclip played an important <input class="blank "id="blank-6" type="text"> role in Norway. During World War II, Norway was occupied by the Nazis. Norwegians were prohibited from wearing any <input class="blank "id="blank-7" type="text"> of their 
        national unity, such as buttons with the initials of their king. Thus, in <input class="blank "id="blank-8" type="text">, they started wearing paperclips to show their solidarity. The reason for doing this was simple: Paperclips were a Norwegian invention whose original function was to bind together. After the war, a giant paperclip statue was erected in Oslo to
        <input class="blank "id="blank-9" type="text"> Vaaler—even though his design was never actually manufactured.
